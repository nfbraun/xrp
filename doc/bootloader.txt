* Bootloader available from:
  http://www.siwawi.arubi.uni-kl.de/avr_projects/#avrprog_boot

* Program high fuse:
  avrdude -p atmega8 -c dapa -U hfuse:w:0xda:m
  
  Default value: 0xD9
  Changes: Program BOOTRST, do not program BOOTSZ0
  Boot program size: [BOOTSZ1:BOOTSZ0] = 01 -> 512 words = 1024 bytes
  
* Program bootloader
  avrdude -p atmega8 -c dapa -E noreset -U flash:w:main.hex
  
* Program user code
  Press RESET (500 ms timeout)
  avrdude -p atmega8 -b 38400 -c butterfly -U flash:w:blink.hex
  
  If the user software handles ESC (0x1B) correctly, RESET is not needed on
  subsequent programmings.

NOTES for ATmega328P:
* Default fuse settings result in 1 MHz clock at startup (internal oscillator
  at 8MHz and CKDIV8 fuse set). With this setting, a precise baud rate of 38.4
  kbps cannot be obtained.

* As of avr-libc 1.6.7, the default wdt_disable() function does not seem to
  work for this chip. The watchdog must be disabled manually (see code example
  in datasheet). (FIXME, try wdt_disable() and MCUSR = 0)
