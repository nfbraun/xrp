/**
	Controller Inspired by Simbicon and Virtual Model Control ideas. Uses IK to control swing foot placement. It assumes
	a pretty specilized character architecture: Legs look like this: 
		root -> hips (3 dof) -> knees (1 dof, around x-axis, for now) -> ankles (doesn't matter how many dofs) -> (may or may not have toes, etc).

	An IKVMCController is a Simbicon Controller. The targets for the swing hip and swing knee are computed using IK, based on a target
	foot location (which is given by the inverted pendulum prediction), and the stance ~hip, knee and ankle torques are computed in part
	by the desired velocity of the CM. Gravity compensation can be added to any rb in the body (propagated to the root). Also, "torque bubbling"
	can be added for any chain that starts at the root.

	TODO:

		- try out some stairs, slopes
		- try some IK for the arm, while walking
		- try some static balance, arms moving...
		- get a less 'hacky' implementation of the desired foot placement position (at least in the sagittal plane).

		- test out 'external' foot placement accuracy - DONE!
		- make walk more natural - how much is simbicon, how much is T = J' * f for push-off? How much does the vertical trajectory of swing foot matter? - DONE!
		- eliminate/reduce the torso/head wobbling. - DONE!
		- stance leg/swing leg velocity/position control through T = J' * f - DONE!
		- get some decent toe-off - Pretty much DONE!
		- torque bubbling - DONE!
		- gravity compensation - DONE!
		- check to see why the crouched walk happens sometime - stance knee should be straight, shouldn't it? - DONE!
		- check to see why swing hip initially goes inwards! - DONE!
		- make sure character can walk in any direction - DONE!
		- limit the extent to which stance ankle 'rolls' on the heel - DONE!
		- how much should the strength of the root be? What works best?
			- doesn't actually matter too much. 1 seems to work best, so we'll go with that.



		- THINGS TO TRY STILL:
			- try to somehow bring the upper body into the motion - maybe simulate the force being applied
			to the CM - i.e. t = dpCM/dq * f, where CM now only takes into account the chain from the head/torso
			to the stance foot - i don't know...
			- upper body - can it be used to make it slow down/speed up/whatever faster?
			- maybe com J'?
