/**
 * A simbicon controller is a fancy PoseController. The root (i.e. pelvis or torso), as well as the two hips are controlled
 * relative to a semi-global coordinate frame (it needs only have the y-axis pointing up), but all other joints are controlled
 * exactely like in a normal PoseController. The SimBiController operates on a biped, which means that we can make special
 * assumptions about it: it must have two joints, lHip and rHip, connecting the root to the left and right upper-legs,
 * and it must also have two feet (lFoot and rFoot) as rigid bodies in the articulated linkage.
