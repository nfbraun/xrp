 | This is the implementation of a Rigid Body class. It holds all the attributes that characterize the rigid body (state information, collision detection primitives, etc).|
 | This class is used as the basis for an Articulated Rigid Body. Together with the PhysicalWorld class, this class is used to implement the dynamics of rigid bodies.     |
 | NOTE: It is assumed that the location of the center of mass of the object in local coordinates is (0,0,0) and that the principal moments of inertia are aligned to the  |
 | local coordinates x, y, and z axes!                                                                                                                                     |
